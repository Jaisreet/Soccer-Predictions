# **Soccer Match Outcome Prediction**  
This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of soccer matches using historical data from a league between 2008 and 2014. As part of this competition, our group utilized advanced predictive modeling techniques and achieved **first position**, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.  

## **Project Overview**  
The goal was to predict match outcomes (home win, away win, or draw) and point differentials for games played in 2015–2016, based on historical match and player data. The challenge required balancing predictive accuracy and generalization for unseen data.

### **Data**  
The dataset consisted of:  
1. **games.csv**: Historical match data, including teams, scores, and game locations.  
2. **players.csv**: Player-level attributes, including overall ratings, potential, work rate, and performance statistics.  
3. **test.csv**: Data for the test period (2015–2016), containing match information but no outcomes.  
4. **example.csv**: A submission-ready file with placeholders for predicted outcomes and point differentials.

## **Key Contributions**  
### **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
- Performed data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.  
- Engineered new features such as **team strengths**, **average player ratings**, and **combined work rates** using player-level data.  
- Coded efficient methods to transform categorical variables like "work rate" into numeric scores for predictive modeling.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Conducted detailed analyses on player and team statistics to identify correlations and trends affecting match outcomes.  
- Visualized relationships between variables (e.g., defensive/attacking work rates and win/loss outcomes) using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### **Model Development**  
- Built and tested multiple predictive models, including:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  
  - Neural Networks (using TensorFlow).  
- Optimized hyperparameters using grid search to improve model performance.  
- Combined model predictions using **ensemble methods** to enhance accuracy.  

### **Evaluation and Results**  
- Achieved outstanding accuracy for the **classification of match outcomes** and **prediction of point differentials**.  
- Submitted the best-performing model to the competition leaderboard, securing **first place** out of multiple participating teams.  

### **Submission & Deployment**  
- Delivered final predictions in the required format, meeting submission guidelines.  
- Documented the methodology, results, and insights in a comprehensive technical report.
